        let age2 = age;

        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;
        console.log(players, team);
        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        //team[3] = 'Lux';
        // however what happens when we update that array?
        //because we updated team - team is reference to original array, so both are updated

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice(); //when passed nothing will make copy
        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);
        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];
        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
        team4[3] = 'Wonder Woman';

        const team5 = Array.from(players);
        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        //start with blank object, assign which object we want to copy, then add in properties we want to add
        const captain = Object.assign({}, person, {
            number: 99
        });
        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const cap2 = {...person
        };
        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
